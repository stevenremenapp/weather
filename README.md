# The Weather App
### Created for freeCodeCamp

[See it live here.](https://stevenremenapp.github.io/weather/)

Allow sharing of your location and receive local date, time, latitude, longitude, sunrise, and sunset times. Use the search bar to search for other cities and receive this information for that city. The background will change depending on the weather and will be darker depending on the position of the sun in that location (this is not super accurate, but close enough).

My first project incorporating an API. I learned how to grab data and display it. I also learned how difficult time can be to work with in JavaScript. I also learned how to refactor JavaScript and how important it is to write readable code.

Weather now! Serenity now!
